<ControlFlowAndLogic>
    <ControlFlowExplanation>
<![CDATA[
The program COACTUPC follows a structured control flow:

1. The program starts with initialization in the 0000-MAIN paragraph.
2. It sets up error handling using EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND.
3. The program then initializes various working storage variables and stores the context.
4. It checks if there's any passed data (EIBCALEN) and processes it accordingly.
5. The program then performs the YYYY-STORE-PFKEY paragraph to map the AID to PFKey.
6. It checks if the AID is valid for the current context.
7. The main decision-making occurs in an EVALUATE TRUE statement, which determines the next action based on user input and program state.
8. Depending on the evaluation, the program may exit, process inputs, decide on actions, or send a map to the user.
9. The program ends with a common return routine that sends the final output to the user.

Throughout its execution, the program uses various paragraphs (e.g., 1000-PROCESS-INPUTS, 2000-DECIDE-ACTION, 3000-SEND-MAP) to handle different aspects of processing.

Here's a comprehensive description of the overall flow and logic of the COACTUPC program:

<DataFlowAndManipulation>
    <DataFlow>
    <![CDATA[
    The COACTUPC program is designed to handle account updates in a credit card system. The data flow in this program can be summarized as follows:

    1. The program receives input data from a CICS screen (CACTUPA) containing account and customer information.
    2. It reads existing account and customer data from files (ACCTDAT and CUSTDAT) using the account ID provided.
    3. The program processes and validates the input data, comparing it with the existing data.
    4. If changes are detected and validated, the program updates the account and customer records in their respective files.
    5. Throughout the process, the program maintains two sets of data: ACUP-OLD-DETAILS and ACUP-NEW-DETAILS, representing the original and updated information respectively.
    6. The program sends output back to the CICS screen, either displaying the updated information or error messages.
    ]]>
    </DataFlow>
    <DataTransformations>
    <![CDATA[
    The program performs several data transformations and manipulations:

    1. Date conversions: The program converts date fields (e.g., open date, expiry date, reissue date) from separate year, month, and day fields to a single YYYY-MM-DD format for storage and processing.

    2. Numeric conversions: The program converts numeric fields (e.g., credit limit, cash credit limit, current balance) from display format to computational format for calculations and comparisons.

    3. Phone number formatting: The program formats phone numbers by combining separate area code, prefix, and line number fields into a single formatted string.

    4. SSN formatting: The program combines three separate SSN fields into a single 9-digit number for storage and processing.

    5. Currency formatting: The program formats currency values (e.g., credit limit, current balance) for display on the screen using a picture clause (PIC +ZZZ,ZZZ,ZZZ.99).

    6. Input validation: The program performs various validations on input data, such as checking for valid dates, numeric values, and required fields.

    7. Comparison of old and new data: The program compares the existing data (ACUP-OLD-DETAILS) with the input data (ACUP-NEW-DETAILS) to detect changes and determine if an update is necessary.

    ]]>
    </ExternalEntitiesDataExchange>
    <ExternalInteractionsPotentialImpacts>
    <![CDATA[
    The external interactions of the COACTUPC program have several potential impacts and considerations:

    1. Data integrity: Since the program updates critical account and customer information, ensuring data integrity is crucial. The program uses CICS file control commands with proper error handling to maintain data consistency.

    2. Performance: The program performs multiple file reads and updates, which could impact performance, especially under high transaction volumes. Efficient file access and update strategies are important.

    3. Concurrency: The program uses CICS READ UPDATE commands to lock records before updating, preventing concurrent updates to the same record. However, this could lead to contention if multiple users attempt to update the same account simultaneously.

    4. Error handling: The program includes error handling for file access and update operations. Proper error messages are displayed to the user, and in case of update failures, the program performs a SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK to ensure data consistency.

    5. Security: The program handles sensitive customer information (e.g., SSN, account details). Ensuring proper access controls and data encryption in the CICS environment is crucial.

    6. Dependency management: The program relies on external copybooks and routines. Any changes to these dependencies could affect the program's functionality and would require careful version management and testing.

    7. Screen interface: The program's heavy reliance on the CACTUPA screen map means that any changes to the screen layout or fields would require corresponding changes in the program logic.

<ProgramLogicAndFunctionality>

<ProgramLogic1>
     <![CDATA[
     This rule manages the updating of account and customer information in a credit card system. It processes various account-related fields such as account status, current balance, credit limits, and important dates. The rule also handles customer details including personal information, address, and contact details.

     The rule first validates the input data for each field, ensuring that the information provided meets specific criteria. For example, it checks if the account status is valid (either active or inactive), if the credit limits are within acceptable ranges, and if dates are in the correct format.

     After validation, the rule prepares the data for updating in the system. It formats the information appropriately, such as structuring dates in the required format and formatting phone numbers with the correct punctuation.

     The rule then attempts to update both the account and customer records in the system. It first tries to lock these records to prevent concurrent modifications. If successful, it compares the current data in the system with the original data that was retrieved when the update process started. This comparison ensures that no other process has modified the data in the meantime.

     If the data hasn't been changed by another process, the rule proceeds with the update. It writes the new information to both the account and customer records. If any part of this process fails, the rule will roll back all changes to maintain data integrity.

     Throughout this process, the rule manages error handling and provides appropriate feedback, such as indicating if the update was successful or if there were issues during the process.

     This rule manages the assignment of customer information in a credit card management system. It processes and stores various details about a customer, including personal information, contact details, and financial data. The rule assigns values to multiple fields that make up a customer's profile, such as their name (split into first, middle, and last), address (including multiple address lines, state, country, and zip code), phone numbers, Social Security Number (), government-issued ID, date of birth,  account ID, primary cardholder status, and  credit score. These assignments are crucial for maintaining accurate and up-to-date customer records in the system. The rule takes input from a user interface and assigns the provided values to the corresponding fields in the customer record structure, preparing the data for subsequent database updates. This ensures that all relevant customer information is captured and stored correctly, supporting various functions of the credit card management system such as account management, customer service, and credit risk assessment.

   - Customer data is read from the CUSTDAT file using the customer ID (WS-CARD-RID-CUST-ID)
   - Card cross-reference data is read from the CARDXREFNAME-ACCT-PATH file using the account ID

3. Data processing flow:
   - Input data is validated and transformed in the 1200-EDIT-MAP-INPUTS paragraph
   - Validated data is stored in the ACUP-NEW-DETAILS structure
   - Old (existing) data is stored in the ACUP-OLD-DETAILS structure
   - The program compares old and new data to detect changes in the 1205-COMPARE-OLD-NEW paragraph

4. Output data flow:
   - Updated account data is written back to the ACCTDAT file
   - Updated customer data is written back to the CUSTDAT file
   - The updated data is displayed on the screen using the CACTUPAO structure
]]>
</DataFlow>

<DataDependency>
<![CDATA[
1. Account and Customer relationship:
   - The CARD-XREF-RECORD links the account ID (XREF-ACCT-ID) with the customer ID (XREF-CUST-ID)
   - This relationship is crucial for retrieving and updating the correct customer data for a given account

2. Data validation dependencies:
   - The program uses various validation flags (e.g., FLG-ACCT-STATUS-ISVALID, FLG-CRED-LIMIT-ISVALID) to ensure data integrity
   - These flags depend on the input data and affect the program's flow and update decisions

3. Date field dependencies:
   - The program validates and processes multiple date fields (e.g., ACUP-NEW-OPEN-DATE, ACUP-NEW-EXPIRAION-DATE, ACUP-NEW-REISSUE-DATE)
   - These dates are interdependent and must be logically consistent (e.g., open date should be before expiration date)

4. Financial data dependencies:
   - The program processes financial fields such as credit limit, cash credit limit, current balance, and cycle credits/debits
   - These fields are interdependent and must maintain logical consistency (e.g., current balance should not exceed credit limit)

5. Update process dependencies:
   - The program's update process depends on the comparison between old and new data (1205-COMPARE-OLD-NEW paragraph)
   - Only changed fields are updated in the database, maintaining data integrity and efficiency

6. Error handling dependencies:
   - The program's error handling (e.g., setting WS-RETURN-MSG) depends on the results of various data validations and database operations
   - These error messages affect the program's flow and the information displayed to the user

7. Screen display dependencies:
   - The data displayed on the screen (CACTUPAO structure) depends on the results of database reads, user inputs, and data validations
   - This affects the user's ability to view and modify account and customer information

<AdditionalConsiderations>
<![CDATA[
While this COBOL program (COACTUPC) does not directly interact with a database using SQL, it does perform file operations on VSAM files. The program reads and updates account and customer data from these files. Here are some relevant details:

1. File Operations:
   - The program reads and updates data from three VSAM files: ACCTDAT (account data), CUSTDAT (customer data), and CARDDAT (card data).
   - File access is performed using CICS commands such as EXEC CICS READ and EXEC CICS REWRITE.

2. Data Retrieval:
   - Account data is retrieved using the account ID as the key (WS-CARD-RID-ACCT-ID-X).
   - Customer data is retrieved using the customer ID as the key (WS-CARD-RID-CUST-ID-X).
   - Card data is retrieved using the card number as the key (WS-CARD-RID-CARDNUM).

3. Data Updates:
   - The program updates both account and customer records after validating user input.
   - Updates are performed using EXEC CICS REWRITE commands.

4. Error Handling:
   - The program checks for various error conditions, such as record not found, during file operations.
   - Error messages are stored in WS-RETURN-MSG and displayed to the user.

5. Transaction Management:
   - The program uses EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT for committing changes.
   - In case of update failures, it performs a rollback using EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK.

6. Locking Mechanism:
   - The program attempts to lock records before updating them to prevent concurrent modifications.
   - If a lock cannot be obtained, it sets an appropriate error message.

7. Data Validation:
   - Extensive data validation is performed on user inputs before updating the records.
   - This includes checks for data types, value ranges, and business rules.

While not using a traditional database, this program demonstrates best practices for data handling, error management, and transaction control in a CICS COBOL environment using VSAM files.

<ErrorAndAbendHandling>

Here's the detailed documentation of the error handling and recovery mechanisms implemented in the COBOL program COACTUPC:

<OverallStrategy>
<![CDATA[
The program COACTUPC employs a comprehensive error handling strategy that primarily relies on CICS (Customer Information Control System) error handling mechanisms. It uses EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND to set up a global error handler for unexpected abends. The program also utilizes specific error checks throughout its execution, particularly during file operations and data validation processes. Error messages are stored in working storage variables and displayed to the user through the BMS (Basic Mapping Support) map.
]]>
</OverallStrategy>

<CommonErrorConditions>
<ListErrors>
<![CDATA[
1. CICS command execution errors (e.g., file read, write operations)
2. Data validation errors (e.g., invalid input data)
3. File access errors (e.g., record not found, duplicate record)
4. Unexpected abends
5. Business logic errors (e.g., data inconsistencies)
]]>
</ListErrors>
<ErrorSources>
<![CDATA[
1. CICS command execution errors: Arise from EXEC CICS commands, indicated by non-zero RESP and RESP2 codes
2. Data validation errors: Originate from user input not meeting specified criteria
3. File access errors: Occur during READ, WRITE, or REWRITE operations on VSAM files
4. Unexpected abends: Can be caused by various unforeseen circumstances in the program execution
5. Business logic errors: Result from data not meeting business rules or unexpected data states
]]>
</ErrorSources>
</CommonErrorConditions>

<ErrorDetectionMechanisms>
<DetectMethods>
<![CDATA[
1. CICS command errors are detected by checking RESP and RESP2 codes after EXEC CICS commands
2. Data validation errors are identified through specific validation routines (e.g., 1200-EDIT-MAP-INPUTS)
3. File access errors are detected by examining RESP codes after file operations
4. Unexpected abends are caught by the global EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND
5. Business logic errors are identified through specific condition checks in the program logic
]]>
</DetectMethods>
<FunctionsAndExceptionCheck>
<![CDATA[
1. EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND LABEL(ABEND-ROUTINE) is used to set up a global abend handler
2. EVALUATE statements are used to check RESP codes after CICS commands
3. Custom validation routines (e.g., 1210-EDIT-ACCOUNT, 1220-EDIT-YESNO) are used to check input data
4. Conditional statements (IF-THEN-ELSE) are used throughout the program to check for error conditions
5. The program uses 88-level condition names (e.g., INPUT-ERROR, FLG-ACCTFILTER-NOT-OK) to represent various error states
]]>
</FunctionsAndExceptionCheck>
</ErrorDetectionMechanisms>

<ErrorResponsesAndRecoveryActions>
<ImmediateResponse>
<![CDATA[
1. For CICS command errors, the program sets appropriate error flags and messages (e.g., setting INPUT-ERROR to TRUE)
2. For data validation errors, the program sets specific error flags (e.g., FLG-ACCT-STATUS-NOT-OK) and prepares error messages
3. For file access errors, the program sets error flags and prepares specific error messages (e.g., DID-NOT-FIND-ACCT-IN-ACCTDAT)
4. For unexpected abends, control is transferred to the ABEND-ROUTINE paragraph
5. For business logic errors, the program sets appropriate flags and prepares error messages
]]>
</ImmediateResponse>
<RecoveryProcedures>
<![CDATA[
1. After detecting errors, the program typically continues execution to the next appropriate section, often returning to the main menu or redisplaying the current screen with error messages
2. In case of file update failures, the program performs a SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK to ensure data integrity
3. For unexpected abends, the ABEND-ROUTINE sends an error message to the user and terminates the program with a custom abend code
4. The program uses the 2000-DECIDE-ACTION paragraph to determine the next course of action based on the current error state
5. There are no explicit retry mechanisms implemented in the program
]]>
</RecoveryProcedures>
</ErrorResponsesAndRecoveryActions>

<ErrorLoggingMechanisms>
<MechanismsDetails>
<![CDATA[
The program does not implement a dedicated error logging mechanism. Instead, it relies on CICS's built-in error logging capabilities. Error information is primarily stored in working storage variables for immediate use in user communication.
]]>
</MechanismsDetails>
<ErrorLogsFormatAndContent>
<![CDATA[
As there is no explicit error logging implemented in the program, this section is not applicable. Error information is primarily stored in working storage variables such as WS-RETURN-MSG and CCARD-ERROR-MSG for immediate display to the user.
]]>
</ErrorLogsFormatAndContent>
</ErrorLoggingMechanisms>

<UserNotificationsAndInterfaceHandling>

   - EXEC CICS XCTL: Transfers control to another program.

4. Error handling:
   - EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND: Sets up abend handling routines.

5. Transaction management:
   - EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT: Commits or rolls back database changes.

<![CDATA[
Error handling during integration processes with CICS in COACTUPC includes:

1. Abend handling: The program uses EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND to set up an abend routine (ABEND-ROUTINE) that handles unexpected errors.

2. File access error detection: The program checks the response codes (WS-RESP-CD and WS-REAS-CD) after file operations to detect and handle errors.

3. Error logging: When errors occur, the program constructs error messages (e.g., WS-FILE-ERROR-MESSAGE) that can be displayed to the user or logged for troubleshooting.

4. Recovery mechanisms: 
   - For file update errors, the program uses EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK to undo changes if an error occurs during the update process.
   - The program provides options to retry operations or return to previous screens in case of errors.

5. User feedback: Error messages are displayed on the screen to inform the user about issues encountered during processing.

6. Conditional logic: The program uses extensive conditional logic to check for various error conditions and handle them appropriately throughout the processing flow.
