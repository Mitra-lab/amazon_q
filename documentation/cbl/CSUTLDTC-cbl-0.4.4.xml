</ProgramName>

<MainPurpose>
<![CDATA[
The main purpose of CSUTLDTC is to validate a given date using the CEEDAYS API. It checks if the provided date is valid according to a specified date format and returns the result of the validation.
]]>
</MainPurpose>

<BusinessContext>
<![CDATA[
This program operates in the context of date validation and processing. It is likely part of a larger system that requires date validation for various business processes, such as data entry, report generation, or data processing where accurate date information is crucial.
]]>
</BusinessContext>

<KeyFeatures>
<![CDATA[
1. Date Validation: The program uses the CEEDAYS API to validate a given date (LS-DATE) against a specified date format (LS-DATE-FORMAT).

2. Error Handling: It provides detailed error messages for various date validation scenarios, such as invalid date values, insufficient data, or unsupported date ranges.

3. Result Reporting: The program generates a message (WS-MESSAGE) containing the severity of the error, message code, validation result, test date, and the date format mask used.

4. Flexible Date Format: The program can handle different date formats as specified by the input parameter LS-DATE-FORMAT.
